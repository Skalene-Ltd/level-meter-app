# Get data from the device with the raw data panel and results section

The 'raw data' panel can be used to get data from the device.
The 'results' section of the sidebar can be used to get the processed results.

> First, make sure the app is [connected to the device](../../#connect-to-the-device).

## Raw data

To get raw data from the device, click the 'retrieve raw data' button in the raw data panel.

Wait for the data to be transferred from the device.
This process is shown by a progress bar.

When the data is ready, a file should appear in the panel.
Click the 'download' button to download the data.
The file will be a `csv` file, so you can open it in a spreadsheet application.

## Results

To get the results from the device, click the 'get results' button in the side bar.

The results should be shown in a grid.
Channels 1 - 4 are in the top row, ordered left to right, and channels 5 - 8 are in the bottom row, ordered left to right.
