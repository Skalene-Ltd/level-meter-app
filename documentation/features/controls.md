# Send commands to the device using the side bar

The 'Device controls' section of the side bar contains controls to send commands directly to the device.

## Quickly change the integration time

To change just the integration time, use the slider labelled 'live patch integration time'.

Click and drag the slider.
The value underneath the slider will change.
When you release the slider, the value will be set on the device.

## Send the `START` and `STOP` commands

The 'start' and 'stop' buttons send those commands to the device.
