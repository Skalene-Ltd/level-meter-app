# Send commands to the device using the side bar

The 'Device controls' section of the side bar contains controls to send commands directly to the device.

## Quickly change the integration time

To change just the integration time, use the slider labelled 'live patch integration time'.

If the slider is locked, a padlock will show under it.
To unlock it, reveal the config panel by checking the 'show advanced' checkbox at the bottom of the app, and then check the 'allow config changes' checkbox.

Click and drag the slider.
The value underneath the slider will change.
When you release the slider, the value will be set on the device.

## Send the `START` and `STOP` commands

The 'start' and 'stop' buttons send those commands to the device.
