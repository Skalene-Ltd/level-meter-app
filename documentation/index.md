# Level Meter App

The level meter app lets you configure the level meter and update its firmware.

## Launch the app

To launch the app, open a window in a compatible web browser (the latest Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) and navigate to [skalene-level-meter.netlify.app](https://skalene-level-meter.netlify.app/).

## Connect to the device

Click on the blue 'connect' button in the 'Serial port' section of the sidebar. A dialogue box should open saying the page wants to connect to the serial port.

Then, plug your device into a USB port on your computer. The device should appear in the dialogue box as `USB Serial Port`. Click to select this opion, and then click 'connect'.

The 'Serial port' section should now say "serial port connected".

Before you use the app, make sure the device is plugged in and switched on.
