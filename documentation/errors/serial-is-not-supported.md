# 'Serial is not supported' error

The level meter app connects to the level meter through a serial port. If you see an error message saying 'Serial is not supported', it means the web browser can't connect to a serial port, so the app won't work.

To fix this error, try these steps.

## Make sure you're using a supported browser

The most likely reason for this error is that your web browser doesn't support serial connections.

Browsers that support serial connections are:

- Google Chrome version 89 or higher
- Microsoft Edge version 89 or higher

Try opening the app in either of the browsers above.

## Use a secure connection

Check the address bar. The web address should start with `https:`. 

If the address starts with just `http:`, the connection is not secure and you'll see the 'Serial is not supported' error.

Change the `http:` to `https:` and press enter.
